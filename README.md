# Needleman-Wunsch-Algorithm
An implementation of the Needleman Wunsch Algorithm

This is a simple algorithm to find the optimal alignment between two DNA sequences to find the evolutionary distance between them.
To use the code, just paste the two sequences on the code between the inverted commas in the first two lines after int main().
The output is the optimal alignment between the sequences. The integer in the third line is the alignment score of the two sequences.
